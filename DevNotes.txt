Dev Notes:

Feb. 2nd (Ground Hog Day)
- Moved all of the C# scripts from a folder called 'Scripts' within the OpenNI folder, to a subfolder of 'Standard Assets' that I titled "CSharp_Scripts"

- Changed two variables in OpenNISingleSkeletonController called IsTracking and userID to public static vars and I was able to reference IsTracking in the GUIScript.js
